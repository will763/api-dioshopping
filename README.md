Backend created during Labs at DIO with node and typescript,
after the expert finished presenting and making his modifications to the frontend and backend
of the project, it was suggested that we make our own modifications, so in the backend part I 
performed unit tests and integrated tests using jest and superTest. On the frontend I used the 
Cypress tool for A complete end-to-end testing experience. In this repository resides the application's backend, 
to see the features that I made, go to the main branch.
